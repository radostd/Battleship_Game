# Battleship game

This application replicates the battleship game normally played on paper by two players. 
In this version there is **one player versus a computer**.

*This app was made in C in Code::Blocks and was part of a course project in one of the subjects in my first year in uni.*

### Rules of the game:
The requirements for the project were:
1. Program on **C**, one player vs. computer.
2. There should be **5 ships** (with consecutive coordinates) per player. 
3. The ships should be with field lenghts as follows - one with **4**, one with **3**, **two with 2** and one with **1** field.
4. The ships of the player should be positioned **at the beginning** of the game.
5. The game field is with size **10x10**.
6. The players **begins with entering coordinates** followed by the computer. 
7. The computer chooses **random** unused coordinates.
8. The **hits** and **misses** are visualized on the screen of the player.
9. The **game ends** when one of the players is left **without** ships.
